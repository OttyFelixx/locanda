Locanda Build Guide (with Maven)

-Clone the project from GitHub (https://github.com/labos/locanda)

-In the project root, there are three .properties file to be customized:
	-global.properties	-> resources paths
	-mysql.properties 	-> mySQL connection parameters
	-hsql.properties 	-> HSQL connection parameters

-To deploy the webapp, in the shell from the project directory type:
	-mvn clean install			to create the build in Locanda_Target folder
	-mvn clean tomcat7:deploy	to create the build in Locanda_Target folder and deploy it in a running Tomcat7 server

-To accomplish the latter task, you need to:
	-configure your Tomcat server in ${tomcat.home}/conf/tomcat-users.xml by adding a user with the roles "manager-script" and "manager-gui"
	-edit the Maven user config file (${user.home}/.m2/settings.xml) uncommenting the "server" tag and putting "tomcat_server" as id and your manager username and password, like this:

		<server>
       	 	<id>tomcat_server</id>
        	<username>tomcat</username>
        	<password>tomcat</password>
		</server>
 
-If you wish to use the HSQL db, you can deploy Locanda using the HSQL profile. Just run Maven with the command:
	-mvn clean tomcat7:deploy -Phsql
	and the config files will be set with the proper HSQL parameters of hsql.properties.
	By activating this profile, the exec plugin will start and populate the HSQL database.
	*BUG TO BE FIXED* The db start is commented due to the fact that it locks the shell, preventing the successful deployment completion
